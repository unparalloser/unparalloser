Hi there! I'm Tanya. I was born in Russia, 0/10 do not recommend.
As a kid I've been making music, and as an adult I discovered art and the ✨*joy of programming*✨. My favorite languages are Clojure (it's so elegant!) and Rust (it's the best low level programming language, period).

I believe all programs should be open source, games included, and until then we're living in dark times.

I love making logos and branding, as well as simple illustrations, pixel art and digital paintings. [Check out my works](https://www.instagram.com/unparalloser_/)! And I'd love to help you beautify your projects and blog posts, too, so be sure to hit me up if you have something like that in mind c:
